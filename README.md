Hey there, this was my first project with javascript. I'm still learning, but manage to produce this fully stylized timer. This must have a lot of errors, but with time I will improve. I hope you enjoy!

In this project, I used four basic javascript functions. The start one, which recursively calls another one to count the seconds minutes and hours, is actually updating the document. One to stop, which just ends the start call. And the last one to keep the two zeros (00:00) when the number is less than ten. We also have the use of location.reload() but this is very basic, it just reloads the page to restart the timer.

I think another notable point is the stylization of the buttons. I think another notable point is the stylization of the buttons. And as mentioned in the last project, I will always leave the sources of this more complex CSS. I believe they add a lot to our learning. So I found this button template <a href="https://getcssscan.com/css-buttons-examples "> here </a> and it was produced by Michael McMillian

  Future I would like to insert a Pomodoro clock in this application. Everything will be documented here :P.

  So this day has finally come, I added a stopwatch <br><br> It works in reverse to the timer function, getting the value by 3 input in a simple popup

  And a Pomodoro, that uses the whole concept learned in the stopwatch, but now with a fixed value, regardless of the input, in addition to the native javascript function the setTimeout to start the 5 minute rest time and restart pomodoro.
